# TCP SEQUENCE No.

Each endpoint of a TCP connection establishes a starting sequence number for packets it sends, and sends this number in the SYN packet 
that it sends as part of establishing a connection.

There is no requirement for either end to follow a particular procedure in choosing the starting sequence number. 
The operating system is free to use any mechanism it likes, but generally it's best if it chooses a random number, as this is more secure.

From that starting point, each packet sent by either end contains two sequence numbers - one to specify where in the stream the packet is,
and an ACK sequence number which signifies the number of bytes received. Both numbers are offset by the starting sequence number.
